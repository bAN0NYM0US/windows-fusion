# Info
  This projects aims to be what Windows 11 should have been. A light and modern OS to imrpove legacy systems and add a modern design for newer devices.
  The project is based off of Windows 11 and removes features like the TPM 2.0 requirment, CPU requirement, and RAM requirement for legacy computers.
  It also removes telemetry annoyances like requring internet and a microsoft account during setup. This is all bypassed to allow a light, legacy, offline setup.
  There have also been many tweaks and software to add more function, but will be scheduled to change paid apps for open source alternatives as the project progresses.
